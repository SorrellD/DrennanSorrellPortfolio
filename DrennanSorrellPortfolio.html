        shape Troder Hall's overall layout, furniture selection, room orientation, and lobby spaces. My role 
        involved coordinating with multiple stakeholders to ensure the building stayed on schedule for its

        <h3>What Makes Troder Hall Special?</h3>
        <p>
          Troder Hall is inspired by the much-loved Summit Hall design but featuring four floors and 
          <strong>120 single beds</strong> in a layout that emphasizes privacy while fostering community. 
          Each suite features two individual dorm rooms connected by a shared bathroom, providing the perfect 
          blend of personal space and communal living. Whether you're an early bird, a night owl, or somewhere

  <h2>Housing Selection Announcement</h2>
  <div class="content-box">
    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Read Carefully: Housing Selection Is Almost Here!</p>
    
    <p>Hello Warriors,</p>
    
    <p>
      It's almost time to select your housing for Fall 2024! Please take a look at the information below 
      to stay updated with the current and future steps in the process.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Housing Application</h3>
    <p>
      Have you completed your Returning Student Housing Application? If yes, great job! You've completed the 
      first step in selecting housing for next year!
    </p>
    <p><strong>How do I Complete the Housing Application?</strong></p>
    <p>
      1. Log in to Let Me In<br>
      2. Go to One-Click-Apps<br>
      3. Locate and open the Housing Portal<br>
      4. On the Home Page, select “Applications.”<br>
      5. Select and complete the “Returning Student Housing Application.”
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Fall 2024 Registration</h3>
    <p>
      Are you registered for classes for Fall 2024? If yes, great job! You've completed the second step 
      in selecting housing for next year! Both of the above steps MUST be completed to participate in 
      Roommate Selection or Room Selection. Residents who are not registered for Fall 2024 will not receive housing.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Roommate Selection</h3>
    <p>
      Want to ensure you're living with friends or someone you'll get along with? Great! Residents who form 
      roommate groups are prioritized in room selection; groups pick before individuals.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Roommate Selection Opens Monday, April 1st @ 10:00 A.M. Here's How It Works:</strong></p>
    <p>
      1. <strong>Login:</strong> Use Indiana Tech's LetMeIn and access One-Click-Apps to select the Housing Portal.<br>
      2. <strong>Complete the Optional Application:</strong> Visit the "Roommate Matching Form" under "Applications" 
         in the housing portal. Although the questions are optional, we encourage you to complete all sections to 
         enhance your chances of finding a perfect match.<br>
      3. <strong>Complete Your Roommate Profile:</strong> Update your contact information under the 
         "Personal Information" tab!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"My Info" is kept private. We ask for details such as your mobile carrier and phone number.</li>
      <li>Addresses and Emergency Contacts are also kept private. We highly recommend completing these sections.</li>
      <li>
        The "Roommate Profile" allows you to choose if you want to display certain information to potential roommates, 
        such as primary contact preferences (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat) and additional details in "My Profile."
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      4. <strong>Search and Select a Roommate:</strong> Head to the "Rooms and Roommates" tab and go to 
         "Select Roommates." Ensure "For the Term:" is set to Fall 2024. Here, you can search for other students 
         using your roommate matching form details and view profiles that match your preferences. If someone 
         catches your eye, their preferred contact information may be visible so you can connect. Requesting a 
         roommate will send them an email; you can also poke or email for an update.
    </p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> To form a roommate group, EVERYONE must request and accept one another! The 
    maximum roommate group size is six residents!</p>
    <p>
      5. <strong>Accepting Roommate Requests:</strong> Any requests you send or receive can be found under the 
         "Rooms and Roommates" tab. You have complete control over your roommate selection for Fall 2024.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Seeking Gender Neutral Housing?</strong><br>
      Residence Life supports gender-neutral housing! If you'd like to form a roommate group with individual(s) 
      of a different gender, please reach out to <a href="mailto:DMSorrell@indianatech.edu">DMSorrell@indianatech.edu</a> 
      for additional details.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Room Selection</h3>
    <p><strong>Group Selection Opens April 15th and Closes April 16th</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Group Selection is for residents who form roommate groups!</li>
      <li>
        Groups will be prioritized based on their average cumulative credit hours completed (all credits 
        completed up to the end of Fall 2023).
      </li>
      <li>
        Groups that can fill an entire suite are given priority. 
        (If your group cannot fill an entire suite, e.g., WRA Apt B or Rogers Apt 1C, 
        you cannot start selecting until a designated time on April 15th, time TBD.)
      </li>
      <li>
        A new group can start selecting every 2 minutes after room selection opens; 
        only one member needs to log in to place the entire group.
      </li>
      <li>Summit and Troder Hall are unavailable during Group Selection.</li>
      <li>Groups that form but do not select a room will be disbanded and added to individual selection.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Individual Selection Opens April 17th and Closes April 19th</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Individual Selection is for residents not in a roommate group!</li>
      <li>
        Individuals will be prioritized based on total credit hours completed 
        (all credits completed up to the end of Fall 2023).
      </li>
      <li>A new individual can start selecting every 1–2 minutes after room selection opens.</li>
      <li>All available upperclassman beds on campus can be selected!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Where Can I Learn More?</h3>
    <p>
      Over the next two weeks, we will release more information about Housing Selection!

      </li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>
      <strong>Not Returning to Housing?</strong><br>
      Ensure you get your Housing Deposit refunded! Log into the Housing Portal and, under Applications, 
      find the "Intending NOT to Return" form. Complete this form if you're unsure, graduating, withdrawing, 
      or requesting release. This form is necessary for your deposit refund, assuming all other requirements 
      are met and your room is in satisfactory condition upon departure.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you plan to continue your education at Indiana Tech but do not intend to return to the residence halls, 
      you must also complete the Housing Exemption/Cancellation Form to continue your enrollment.

    <h3>Housing Selection Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Returning Student Housing Selection will take place the week of April 15th. Like last year, the housing selection will be 
      broken into two processes. To participate in the Housing Selection process, students must complete the 
      <strong>Returning Student Housing Application</strong> and be registered for classes for the Fall 2024 semester.
    </p>
    <p>
      On April 1st, students who have registered for classes and completed the application can start creating roommate groups 
      in the housing portal. The maximum group size is 6. Students will be able to search for one another or the qualities of 
      students they prefer. Everyone in a group must confirm one another to become a complete group. For example, Sarah and Lee 
      are a matched group, Olivia wants to join the group, Olivia must request BOTH Sarah and Lee, and BOTH Sarah and Lee have 
      to accept Olivia's request. This same process will be available for incoming new students! A confirmed roommate group 
      will override a coach's pairing request.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 15th will kick off group selection; students who use the housing portal to form a roommate group will select first. 
      Group selection priority will be based on the group's average total credit hours completed. Only one group member should 
      log in at the selecting time to select placement for the entire group. Roommate groups must fill the entire desired suite 
      to select it. Summit and Troder (new) Halls will be unavailable to select during group selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individual selection will take place following group selection. Students who did not form a group can select in order 
      based on total credit hours completed. Summit and Troder Halls will be available for selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who miss housing selection must communicate with Residence Life Staff; they will be manually placed into housing 
      or given a makeup selection date.
    </p>

  <h2>Resident Assistant Practical Interview</h2>
  
  <!-- Project Background (Outside the white box) -->
  <p><strong>Project Background:</strong> Each year, approximately 100 students apply for the Resident Assistant position. Candidates complete two rounds of interviews: 
    the first is an initial interview to get to know the candidate and assess their understanding of the role, and the second is a practical paired assessment 
    where candidates work together on scenarios relevant to the RA position. Current RAs also participate in these interviews. Additionally, 
    to be considered for the RA position, candidates must attend an RA information session, complete an application, submit a resume, provide two letters 
    of recommendation, and participate in both interview rounds.

    <p><strong>Resident Assistant Practical Interview Script and Scenarios</strong></p>
    
    <p>Full Name Printed: ___________________________________________</p>
    
    <p>
      Welcome to the second round of interviews for the RA position! This round is a practical assessment 
      where we will observe your ability to interact with each other and perform tasks relevant to the position.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This assessment aims to gauge your interpersonal skills, teamwork, and understanding of the responsibilities 
      and expectations of the RA role. We will begin by having you introduce yourselves and share a brief overview 
      of your background and experience. Then, we will present you with a series of scenarios and tasks to complete together.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Please remember that there are no right or wrong answers for these assessments. Handle each situation 
      to the best of your ability, communicate effectively, and take the initiative.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Is there anything you would like to clarify before we begin?</strong></p>
    
    <hr style="margin: 2rem 0;">
    
    <p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You have been informed that there is a conflict between two roommates on your floor: one international and one domestic student. 
      The issue centers on differences in expectations regarding room cleanliness and odor. One of the residents has emailed your supervisor to complain, 
      stating that the disagreement has created a tense atmosphere in the room. Your task is to mediate this conflict and find a resolution that respects 
      both parties' comfort and living preferences.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
    <p>
      1. Discuss and devise a strategy for mediating the conflict effectively, ensuring both parties feel heard and respected.<br>
      2. Role-play or outline how you and your Co-RA would facilitate a mediation meeting between the two students, addressing their concerns and suggesting compromises.<br>
      3. Determine potential follow-up actions to monitor the situation and ensure that the agreed-upon resolutions are implemented and sustained.
    </p>
    
    <hr style="margin: 2rem 0;">
    
    <p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Recently, there have been numerous roommate disputes and general policy violations on your floor, and residents don't seem to be 
      enjoying their living environment. Your supervisor has recommended that you plan and execute an event to foster community building and unity among residents.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
    <p>
      1. Brainstorm ideas for the event, taking into account the interests and preferences of your residents.<br>
      2. Develop a detailed plan for the event, including the theme, location, activities, and budget.<br>
      3. Role-play or outline how you would approach and communicate with residents to gather feedback and encourage participation.<br>
      4. Identify potential challenges and create contingency plans for the event.<br>
      5. Present your event plan along with any funding requirements.
    </p>
    
    <hr style="margin: 2rem 0;">
    
    <p><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> One of the residents, a first-year student, is struggling academically and emotionally. The student has approached you for support, 
      and you want to help them succeed.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
    <p>
      1. Brainstorm ways to support the student, considering their specific needs and challenges.<br>
      2. Develop a plan of action for assisting the student, including identifying relevant resources and coordinating with other professionals if needed.<br>
      3. Role-play or outline how you would approach and communicate with the student to offer support and encouragement.<br>
      4. Discuss potential challenges and contingency plans for providing long-term support to the student.

      We encourage you to explore other leadership opportunities at Indiana Tech. Many of these roles, 
      even in a volunteer capacity, offer valuable experiences and help foster meaningful connections 
      within the campus community.

    <p>
      Engaging a large population of students, many of whom are actively involved in collegiate athletics and 
      frequently prefer scrolling through social media after a long day, presents unique challenges in fostering engagement. 
      Resident Assistants were responsible for event conceptualization, planning, proposal, and production. As Coordinator, 
      I took responsibility for event approval and budget allocation, while also providing an extra marketing push when 
      traditional flyers were not enough. To meet this need, I implemented additional strategies including dynamic social media 
      video content, creatively designed flyers, and targeted email marketing.

      <em>Do you really think you are the best dorm on campus?</em><br>
</p>
      From <strong>October 28 to November 8</strong>, Indiana Tech's <strong>#UCanCrushHunger</strong> campaign begins, and this 
      year, we're going all in with a <em>dorm vs. dorm</em> competition. Whichever building scores the most points 
      by placing cans in the Andorfer Commons donation bins or by donating online will win!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The winning building will claim a <strong>HUGE trophy</strong> to display in the lobby and hold bragging rights!<br>
      President Einolf also plans to host a building-wide <strong>Pizza Party</strong> for the winning dorm.<br>
      Right now, Troder Hall is in the lead!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This competition aims to fight hunger in northeast Indiana, supporting food-insecure families and college 
      students across the region. Our goal is to help Community Harvest collect <strong>130,000 pounds of food</strong> 
      that will provide meals to families in need during the holidays.

      We are excited to inform you that beginning this evening, the first-floor kitchen will be fully

      supplies are able to be used by anyone at any time in the Troder Hall kitchen area.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      However, using these supplies does not come without responsibility. By using community kitchen 
      supplies, you are responsible for the care and cleanliness of what you use, immediately following 
      your need for their use. This means when you are leaving the kitchen area, the community supplies 
      and the kitchen as a whole should be neat, tidy, clean, and put away (not soaking in the sink or 
      drying on the counter).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As residents of Troder Hall, everyone plays a part in maintaining the kitchen. Supplies like pots 
      and pans will not be purchased again this academic year.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Important!</strong> The community kitchen cabinets are used to store community kitchen supplies 
      only. If your supplies, food, etc., are being stored in the kitchen cabinets, please remove them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Want to see what these supplies look like? Want to know how you can make sure you are leaving the 
      kitchen up to standard? Join us tonight! Resident Assistants Lucca and Becca are hosting Pasta Night

    <p><strong>I. Executive Summary</strong><br>
      The Keystone Bacon and Bourbon Festival has the opportunity to become one of Colorado's signature summer festivals. However, with ticket sales falling behind last year's pace, we must create a powerful, targeted marketing strategy to incentivize ticket purchases and increase overall awareness for 2025's festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our strategy will focus on:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Driving ticket sales growth by refining our digital and traditional marketing efforts, leveraging strategic partnerships, and enhancing customer engagement.</li>
      <li>Addressing feedback from past festivals to improve both the on-site experience and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</li>
      <li>Creating urgency using early-bird promotions, targeted advertising, and clear messaging around VIP and family-friendly packages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By focusing on these areas, we are confident in our ability to meet and exceed the festival's sales goals, engage a broader audience, and continue solidifying the festival's reputation as a premier destination for local, regional, and out-of-state attendees.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>II. 2024 Performance Analysis</strong><br>
      As a result of our reduced ticket sales, we will need to rely on insights from our past festivals. Our useful review metrics will include feedback from attendees who bought and did not buy tickets, vendors, and internal assessments. While we don't have concrete 2024 data at this time, we can anticipate that guest feedback will highlight challenges typical of significant festivals of this scale.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;"><strong>1. Expected Guest Insights</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2.5rem; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Festival guests who did not buy tickets may desire more value-driven ticketing options, like bundled deals for families or clearer distinctions between VIP and general admission experiences.</li>
      <li><strong>b.</strong> Feedback-based responses may point to operational improvements, such as crowd flow management and accessibility to our featured events like the Bacon Eating Contest or VIP Bourbon Tour.</li>
      <li><strong>c.</strong> Local attendee attendance might indicate a need for an increase in locally-focused advertising efforts, mostly through physical marketing and partnerships with nearby businesses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;"><strong>2. Adjustments for 2025</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2.5rem; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>a.</strong> To address expected price sensitivity, we will offer early-bird pricing opportunities communicated through our various media platforms to accompany the increased promotion of our VIP packages and Family Four-Pack bundles to communicate value and drive urgency in purchasing decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>b.</strong> Our VIP attendees expect a seamless and premium experience. Based on our expected festival experience feedback, we must simplify vendor placements, enhance signage, and improve the festival's layout to provide a smoother guest experience.</li>
      <li><strong>c.</strong> We will engage Keystone residents with more direct outreach (flyers, local radio ads) and cross-promotions with local businesses to promote a deeper connection between the festival and the community.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>III. Marketing Goals</strong><br>
      We've established the following goals for 2025's festival to meet the expectations of our stakeholders:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Increase ticket sales by 20% by boosting festival awareness and incentivizing early and family ticket purchases.</li>
      <li>Broaden audience reach by using traditional media strategies to target regional markets like Denver and digital advertising tools to target out-of-state consumers driven by tourism.</li>
      <li>Enhance attendee satisfaction by communicating and addressing our expected guest feedback while improving our festival logistics, vendor visibility, and family-friendly offerings.</li>
      <li>Utilize local partnerships, grassroots promotions, and direct mail to Keystone's residents and businesses to increase community and volunteer engagement.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>IV. Marketing Strategy</strong><br>
      Our marketing goals outline a significant initiative to set the standard for the Bacon and Bourbon Festival and all of Keystone's future festivals. Here's how we will execute our strategy:
    </p>
    
    <!-- Sub-section: Digital Marketing -->
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;"><strong>1. Digital Marketing</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5rem;">
      Our digital marketing approach will be optimized to maximize potential customer reach and ticket sales:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 3.5rem; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>a. Meta Business Suite and Facebook Ads</strong><br>
        i. We will run targeted campaigns based on key audience segments (families, food lovers, and music enthusiasts). Our ads will remarket to users who have visited the festival page but have not purchased tickets. Facebook Events Ads will also help promote awareness within our local and regional groups.</li>
      <li style="margin-top: 0.8rem;"><strong>b. Google Ads and AI-Powered Campaigns</strong><br>
        i. We'll create search campaigns optimized for keywords such as "the best Colorado food festivals," "family-friendly events in Colorado," and "bourbon tastings near Denver." We can automate adjustments for our target customers using Google's AI-powered ad features while optimizing ad spending and performance.</li>
      <li style="margin-top: 0.8rem;"><strong>c. Instagram Reels and Stories</strong><br>
        i. Visual content will be a significant player in our engagement strategies. We'll create Instagram Reels and Stories that showcase the behind-the-scenes preparation, vendor spotlights, and attendee testimonials from past festivals. Interactive polls and countdown stickers will help us build anticipation.</li>
      <li style="margin-top: 0.8rem;"><strong>d. YouTube Pre-Roll Ads</strong><br>
        i. Short, engaging videos will run as pre-roll ads targeting food enthusiasts, families, and festival-goers on YouTube. These ads will link directly to the ticket purchasing page and emphasize time-sensitive promotions like early bird pricing.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Sub-section: Traditional Media -->
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>2. Traditional Media</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5rem;">
      Our traditional media will guarantee we're engaging regional markets and nearby communities:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 3.5rem; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Through partnerships with popular local stations like KBCO and KRFX, we will run ads targeting high-traffic listening times to boost ticket sales. We will mostly focus on drive-time slots. Our messaging will highlight festival hype, exclusive deals, and codes for early purchases and group ticket packages.</li>
      <li style="margin-top: 0.8rem;"><strong>b.</strong> Print ads in The Denver Post and Summit Daily News will target regional readers by showcasing upcoming festival highlights, family offerings, and VIP experiences.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Sub-section: Community Engagement -->
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>3. Community Engagement and Grassroots Marketing</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5rem;">
      Our local community involvement is essential to the success of Keystone Festivals. Here's how we'll foster engagement:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 3.5rem; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Distributing mail and door hangers throughout the Keystone community and surrounding areas with exclusive local discounts will drive interest from the community. The flyers will feature a QR code for easy ticket purchasing and highlight a festival schedule or events like Camp Bacon for families.</li>
      <li style="margin-top: 0.8rem;"><strong>b.</strong> We'll create a "win-win," boosting ticket sales and local business engagement by collaborating with local businesses for cross-promotions and offering festival-goers discounts at restaurants or cafes if they show their festival tickets.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Sub-section: Strategic Influencer Campaigns -->
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
      <strong>4. Strategic Influencer Campaigns</strong><br>
      a. While influencer marketing is not a primary driver of our marketing strategy, we will engage with local micro-influencers specializing in food, family activities, and Colorado events to promote the festival to their niche audiences. These collaborations will be low-cost and focus on organic posts in exchange for VIP tickets or festival passes.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>V. Content Creation and Management</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Starting early, we'll tease the lineup, feature bacon vendors, and show off exclusive bourbon tastings.</li>
      <li>We'll create highlights or repost announcements for vendors, musicians, and sponsors to develop excitement.</li>
      <li>On the festival days, we'll use Instagram Stories and Facebook Live to show the festival in action.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>VI. Festival Operations and Customer Experience</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Camp Bacon must continue to expand and offer more engaging, kid-friendly activities.</li>
      <li>The VIP Bourbon Tour must justify the higher ticket price with exclusive tastings and benefits.</li>
      <li>We will simplify booth placement and improve signage for easier navigation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>VII. Post-Festival Engagement and Feedback</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;"><strong>1. Post-Festival Surveys</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2.5rem; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Gathering feedback on ticket purchasing, on-site logistics, and favorite activities.</li>
      <li><strong>b.</strong> Asking about satisfaction with ticket pricing, VIP/family packages, and improvements.</li>
      <li><strong>c.</strong> Encouraging suggestions for vendor variety, entertainment lineup, or family-friendly features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
      Each instance of feedback is valuable in refining future festivals.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;"><strong>2. Vendor and Sponsor Feedback</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2.5rem; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Gauge vendor satisfaction with placement and foot traffic.</li>
      <li><strong>b.</strong> Determine if sponsors felt they received sufficient exposure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
      This helps refine booth positioning and sponsorship visibility.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;"><strong>3. User-Generated Content (UGC) Campaigns</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2.5rem; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Encourage attendees to share photos/videos via #BaconAndBourbon2025; feature the best UGC post-event.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;"><strong>4. Post-Festival Social Media Recap</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2.5rem; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Post highlights a few days later, showcasing behind-the-scenes, best UGC, and memorable moments.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>VIII. Budget Considerations</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; list-style-type: none;">
      <li><strong>1.</strong> Invest in digital advertising (Facebook, Instagram, Google Ads, YouTube) for audience targeting.</li>
      <li><strong>2.</strong> Reserve funds for local radio ads (drive-time spots on KBCO, KRFX) and print ads in The Denver Post and Summit Daily News.</li>
      <li><strong>3.</strong> Set aside a portion for third-party partnerships and content creation.</li>
      <li><strong>4.</strong> Allocate funds to enhance the VIP package and improve signage.</li>
      <li><strong>5.</strong> Keep a contingency fund for unforeseen expenses or last-minute pushes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>IX. KPIs and Success Metrics</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;"><strong>Ticket Sales Metrics</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2.5rem; list-style-type: none;">

    </ul>
